# Example configuration for access AlarmTILT web service
# 
# Define the correct configuration file to use by passing "--config=..." on the command line!
# 
# We can list a number of URLs with different schemes (https/https)
# If there are several URLs with the same scheme, the URL last encountered is used
#
# This also applies to values: the value last encountered is used
# Credentials must be given as USERNAME::PASSWORD , the "::" is the separator
#
# The following key-value pairs exist:
#
# url            = One of possibly several WSDL URLs to contact 
# secure         = boolean (yes/no, true/false etc), if yes, preferentially use the "https" scheme
#                  should be true (the default)
# hostnameverify = verify the remote hostname against the certificate if https is used
#                  should be true (the default)
# service        = service to call; allowed are "ping" and "launch"
#                  (this is not the name of the webservice as such, just a case-insensitive string
#                   identifier. For example the actual name for the ping service as given in the
#                   WSDL is 'pingService')
# procedure      = in case of "launch" service, the name of the procedure to actually launch
#                  (this is not the name of the webservice as such, just a case-insensitive string
#                   identifier)            
# credentials    = credentials to give to remote server; format is always USERNAME::PASSWORD
#

# In here, we just give default URLs and say that we want the "unsecure" one by default (because
# one may want to debug using tcpdump) The originating server may not even have DNS, so we give
# the IP.
