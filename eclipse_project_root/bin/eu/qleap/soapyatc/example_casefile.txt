# Map the numeric cases from WinCC to the names of AlarmTILT procedures to launch
# If there is a new numeric case in WinCC, nothing needs to be changed in WinCC
# or in the procedure that call the AlarmTILT SOAP client. Just add the mapping here.
# However (unfortunately), new procedures outside of the set given below need
# modifiction of the AlarmTILT client as the procedure names are basically enums.
# This would need some change.
