# This is just a test file
# Note that we can list a number of URLs with different schemes (https/https)
# If there are several URLs with the same scheme, the URL last encountered is used
# This also applies to values: the value last encountered is used
# Credentials must be given as USERNAME::PASSWORD , the "::" is the separator
#
# The following key-value pairs exist:
#
# url            = One of possibly several WSDL URLs to contact 
# secure         = boolean (yes/no, true/false etc), if yes, preferentially use the "https" scheme
#                  should be true (the default)
# hostnameverify = verify the remote hostname against the certificate if https is used
#                  should be true (the default)
# service        = service to call; allowed are "ping" and "launch"
# procedure      = in case of "launch" service, tghe procedure to launch
# credentials    = credentials to give to remote server; format is always USERNAME::PASSWORD
